# Getting Started

Welcome to the tutorial section of Plugin Essentials!
<br>
Here, you will learn what the requirements are, and how you can install the resource, as well as information about the libraries within it.

## Requirements

To use Plugin Essentials, you need to install [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/latest/).<br>
Fusion is the UI library that the components within Plugin Essentials are built with. So you must install it inside your plugin.

You can install Fusion wherever you want within your Plugin, Plugin Essentials will automatically find and use it.

## Installation

Installing Plugin Essentials is pretty easy! Just head over to this [link](https://github.com/TenebrisNoctua/PluginEssentials/releases/latest) to download the `.rbxm` file that contains the source code.

After the download, open Roblox Studio, go into `PluginDebugService` and right click on your Plugin instance, and select "Insert From File".

Select the `PluginEssentials.rbxm` file that you just downloaded, and if the `PluginEssentials` folder has appeared, congratulations, the installation is complete!

## Plugin Components

The Plugin Components is a library that provides components made to create certain core aspects of plugins, such as Windows and ToolbarButtons. Using these components, you can easily build the foundation of your plugin.

Using the navigation bar, you can find tutorials and examples of the components within this library.

## Studio Components

The Studio Components is a library that provides components made to replicate the built-in components of Roblox Studio, such as checkboxes, dropdowns, and more. These components provide a very similar experience to using Roblox Studio's built-in components, thus, users recognise these components and know how to use them.

Using the navigation bar, you can find tutorials and examples of the components within this library.
